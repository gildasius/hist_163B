<h2>Jacob and Joseph, Gen 37</h2>
<p>
	Where is the divinity in this story? Now there is a more distant
mechanism, something called divine providence. Notice that Joseph
has dreams whereas Jacob has "visions at night" (46.2). Joseph is
the younger brother, but not the youngest, since there is Benjamin,
son of Rachel like him.

<p>37.1 וישב יעקב בארץ מגוּרי אביו בארץ כנען
<i>And Jacob resided in the land of his fathers’ sojournings, in the land of Canaan.</i>
Rashi tells a wonderful mashal (from <em>Tanḥuma</em>, וישב, א) regarding the curious structure of Genesis, namely that one has ten generations that go quickly by without any detail, then a lengthening story with Noah, followed again by ten generations, and again considerable detail for Abraham:
<blockquote>A parable concerning a pearl that fell amid the sand.  A man takes the sand and sifts it in a sieve until he finds the pearl.  When he finds it, he throws away his  troubles and takes the pearl.
</blockquote>
<p>
	But why indeed these long lava flows of uninterrupted  “and he begat...”?  Isn’t it to underline that human life at its best is not a genealogical story with a sort of built-in entropy, but an election, a promise, with difficult and unexpected accomplishments.  Nothing, in the stories of Noah, Abraham, and Jacob, goes according to genealogical line.  And what is acquired seems often irremediably lost, only to be miraculously recovered.
	<p>
		The vocabulary used by the author to speak of his putative ancestor’s land is curious: Jacob is a resident, like Elijah the Tishbite of 1 Kgs 18-19, and his immediate ancestors were the equivalent of μέτοικοι or κατοίκοι.  This land is known to be that of Canaan, as one knows it from late Bronze age Egyptian texts.  But does this way of considering one’s relationship to the mountain massif of Israel-Judah refer to a souvenir of an historical reality at  the end of the 2d millenium BCE, or is it a retrojection into this past of a 6th c. BCE post-exilic view of history?  In this view, spelled most clearly in Ezekiel, some of the descendants of Jacob have indeed the most tenuous attachment to their country of origin.  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in this view, are examplary settlers or returnees from the East to a land which can be inherited only if the relationship with God and fellow human beings has a certain quality.

<p>
	37.2:  והוּא נער את-בני בלהה ואת-בני זלפה נשי אביו ויבא יוֹסף  	
<em>	את-דבתם רעה אל-אביהם:  And he was a youngman with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and he would report their bad doings to their father</em>.  He is telling on his brothers, or rather on a particular set of his brothers, "the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah."  What is their reputation?  Do they go stealing from their "father" (such as sacrificing a goat here and there?).  Or when they are "out in the field," leading the flocks, do they go brutalizing people (women?) around?  They are the sons of slave women: do they expect to be pushed aside by the other brothers, especially by Rachel's sons, since Rachel is the favored wife?  They are in the situation of Ishmael, sacrificed by the system of inheritance, or at least this is how they see it?  But then, why does Joseph want to be close to them: is he attracted by the rough side they present?

<p>
	37.3:  וישראל אהב את-יוֹסף מכל-בניו כי-בן-זקנים הוּא לוֹ ועשה לוֹ כתנת פסים
	<em>And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because he was his son of old age, and he made him a color coat.</em>
	"Son of his old age:" this would suit Benjamin better.  The sign of Jacob's favoritism (which is an image of Rebecca's favoritism of Jacob) is this special coat, perhaps a coat with sleeves, or many colored (with Greek, but Aquila perhaps had "[going to] the ankles") (cf. the seamless tunic of Jesus in the story of the passion).  This coat, according to some targumim and midrashim, is the original clothing given by the divinity to Adam/ Eve (what of Eve's set in the commentaries, however?  Disappeared, "faute de besoin?").  There are speculations about Joseph's role as a prefiguration of the suffering messiah, as different, but paired with, the son of David, the triumphant messiah.
Note that Jacob is called Israel here.  This seems to be the mark of a later author keen to show that the inhabitants of the northern Israel kingdom are the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph’s sons, and that there is a direct line from Jacob/Israel to the historical Israel.
<p>
37.4  Joseph is hated before he utters his dreams of domination.
<p>
37.5-11: Dreams… regarding brothers and family, on earth and in the skies.  His name, Joseph, is an harbinger of the “accumulation” or “adding” of dreams and “harvesting” he is about to do in Egypt.
His dreams lead to an “accumulation” of hate against him: they “josephed” more and more hate... 
Interesting note by Rashi on the second dream: isn’t his mother already dead?  Then why does Jacob mention her?  Is it because Bilhah acts as his mother (nice idea)?  Or better that Jacob wants to protect Joseph against his brothers’ jealousy and therefore mentions his mother, in such a way as to make them understand that if the dream mentions the mother, who is already dead, then the dream can’t be exact either about his brothers.

<p>
	37.11: ויקנאו-בוֹ אחיו  And his brothers were jealous of him.  The Hebrew word for jealousy echoes the name of  Cain.
<em>His father kept the thing (in his heart)</em>: cf. Lk 2.51, which is also a story of reversals.  Does Jacob realize the intensity of the jealousy, or is he blind to it (as blind as his father Isaac, and forgetful of his own struggles in his youth)?  Rashi and the rest of the tradition seem intent on thinking that the father, who also has suffered at his brother’s hand, already knows.

<p>
	37.12ff.: And his brothers went to pasture their father’s herd in Schechem.  There is something problematic in this going (out often, or implying going into the wild or the “field”), and entailing a dissolution of rules and law.  Perhaps the problem is purely lexical, in the echo of “badness” that trails the לרעוֹת (to pasture): the words for "bad" and "pasture" sound at least consonantically similar (not their vowels however)?  It is reinforced nevertheless by the place they are reaching, Schechem, a place marked as Canaanite in the previous story of Dinah (or Hivvite), i.e. given to foreign gods.  The author is thinking of the historical polytheism practiced in their capitals by Israelite kings in the 9th to 7th c.?
Why does Jacob send Joseph to check on the other ten brothers?  Also to check on them perhaps: after all, he is the first son of Rachel, the beloved or chosen wife, whereas eight of the brothers are by Leah, her servant, or Rachel's servant.  If there is competition between the wives or substitute wives, as the Bible clearly says, one may suspect that the jealousy between brothers or groups of brothers is even keener because more vicarious.
Sichem = Schechem: in the northern mountain massif, about 3 days walk from Hebron, which is at the southern tip of the mountain region.

<p>
	37.13:  Are the brothers hungry and waiting for special food from home (fresh pita; fruit perhaps; virgin olive oil; perhaps wine?).  They eat …. Joseph? not quite, says the story. 
Note for comparison the gospel parable in which a king/master sends his son to the tenants (Mt 21, Mk 12, Lk 20).  Compare also with the Talmud stories about a son being sent to workers or tenants to manage them and who is asked by workers to feed them as the master doesn't seem to be coming to "feed" them.    The son does it, by praying God for a miracle and obtaining fruit "out of season."  But it is at his own risk of being himself "harvested out of season," a judgment cast by the father who finally arrives]
<p>
	Midrash Rabbah on Gen 37.13:
<blockquote><em>And he said to him: Here am I</em>.  R. Hama b. R. Hanina said: Our ancestor [Jacob] was ever mindful of these words and was consumed with remorse.  'I knew that thy brethren hate thee, and yet thou didst answer me: Here am I.' [Lit., "his bowels were cut up."
  <em>Midrash Rabbah</em>, Genesis, (vol. 2, London: Soncino, 1939), p. 779.  ET by Rabbi Dr. H. Freedman.]</blockquote>
<p>
My own reading, in view of the story of Abraham and Isaac, the hinneni, the fact that Jacob was aware of the brothers' hate, his own appreciation for the hate that brothers can harbor for each other, and also the fact that he immediately will go into mourning, goes along with the midrashic interpretation.  But the midrash adds, cautiously, that Jacob foresaw the events (see Gen 37.11), and was also willing (as Joseph was apparently, rash young thing he was) to fulfill the "deep designs" of the Holy One….

<p>
	In vss. 12ff., all the brothers are involved, not only Bilha's and Zilpa's sons, but the story is told from two different angles: paternal preference leads to thoughts of murder, stopped by Juda who advises selling to Ishmaelites; or the outlandish dreams lead to same murderous thoughts, blocked by Reuben, after he has been sold to passing Midianites.  One standard explanation is that the J and E documents or traditions (De Vaux) have been mixed, so well mixed in fact that several scholars question the usefulness of the documentary hypothesis.
	<p>
One can read the seemingly contradictory stories as one: Judah, by selling Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 shekels of silver, is spiting Reuben, the older son (Judah is the younger son of the first set of sons by Leah), who is trying to save Joseph.  Judah has his own agenda.
 <p>
37.25: Notice the meal of the brothers: it is once expressed, but implied the second time.
 <p>
37.31-33: Joseph's tunic dipped in the blood of a he-goat (<em>se`ir `izzim</em>; but see Greek versions which understand "kid").  Jacob will be fooled by a goat's blood, a revisiting of his own tricks.  Does he understand what has happened and play the fool?
