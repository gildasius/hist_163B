<H2>On the `Aqedah (Gen 22)</H2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>Abram, the Aramaean who has settled somewhere between Schechem and the Negev
(under the oaks of Mamre?), has become wealthy (see 12.16, at the end of the
episode in Egypt). He builds altars.</P>

<P>In Gen 13, the tension between Lot's and Abram's herders has been solved
amiably. Lot chooses the Jordan valley, which supposedly was well-watered in
this tale (contrary to its true nature), he goes East (wrong choice?), before
the valley gets destroyed by a flood of fire.</P>

<P>Now, a problem: who is going to inherit Abram's promise, and his claim on
the land of Canaan (not yet Israel)? Eliezer of Damascus (15.2)? "A slave born
in my house." God answers: "your own son." Abram "believed the Lord; and he
reckoned it to him as righteousness." (15.6), but he seeks a covenant, throught
the sacrifice of three-year old victims (heifer; she-goat; ram; plus turtledove
and pigeon). Ishmael, the son of a slave woman, cannot be this heir either.</P>

<P>Thirteen years later, the covenant is repeated, and its sign is the
circumcision (ch. 17). And there is the promise of another son who will be born
to Sarah (who is 90). Abraham laughs, as Sarah will laugh too (Isaac).</P>

<P>In chapter 18, the Lord appears to Abraham (3/2)... Read 18.1-8, an example
of extreme hospitality, especially if one compares it to that of Lot in
19.1ff.</P>

<h3>Ishmael and Isaac</h3>

<P>In Gen 21.1-21, Ishmael is a sort of sacrifice (to Isaac). He is cast out by
Sarah, which is "displeasing to Abraham." The elements that can be set in
parallel are:</P>

<P>Abraham rose early</P>

<P>food on the shoulder (not wood, however)</P>

<P>cast the child under one of the bushes (thicket)</P>

<P>lift up the lad (versus lay hand on the lad)</P>

<P>God opened her eyes (cf. ram)</P>

<h3>Human sacrifices</h3>

<P>See 2 Kgs 17.17 and 3.27, concerning the king of Moab, in the time of king Mesha, the herder:</P>
<blockquote>Then he took his eldest son who
   was to reign in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering
   upon the wall. And there came great wrath upon Israel; and they
   withdrew from him and returned to their own land.
</blockquote>

<P>In Greek history or mythology rather, one thinks of the parallel story of
the sacrifice of Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, demanded by Artemis as the
price for sending a favorable wind to the Greek fleet awaiting to sail for
Troy. Perhaps because the goddess was offended by the killing of a sacred</P>
