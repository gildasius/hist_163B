<H2>Mesopotamian and other myths of
overpopulation and flood</H2>

<P>See N. Cohn, <I>Noah's Flood. The Genesis Story in Western
Thought</I>. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996.</P>

<H3>Sumer (3d millenium bce)</H3>

<P>The hero is a king-like figure in these stories. After the flood,
new cities are built "on holy places," where kings and priests
officiate.</P>

<H3>Atrahasis Epic (Old Babylonian text, ca. 1635 bce)</H3>

<P>Human servants are created to serve the gods, from among the gods
themselves. The number of these humans, presumably reproducing at an
accelerated pace, and the noise they create, become such a nuisance
for the pantheon that the council of gods attempt to control the
problem by taking a variety of measures:</P>
    <ol>
        <li>Plague</li>
        <li>Drought</li>
        <li>A more severe famine</li>
        <li>A flood eventually, in a most drastic and unthinking way.</li> 
    </ol>
<P>But Enki
protects the "very wise one" (Atrahasis), who builds a boat in 7
days. The gods together start the flood, soon followed by a period of
mourning, because food is lacking. In this story, the boat lands on a
mountain top, and we have a succession of birds as in Noah's story:
dove, swallow, raven. When Atrahasis comes out of the ark / boat, he
sacrifices a sheep and offers incense.
</P>

<P>In spite of the flood, then, the survival of the species is
assured, which makes Enlil furious. But a compromise is struck with
Enlil: the exponential growth of the human population will be kept in
check by barrenness or the death of children, even by women's
celibacy.</P>

<H3>The Greek myth of Deucalion and Pyrrha</H3>

<P>Deucalion is a sort of Greek Noah (there is a version of this
story in Ovid' <I>Metamorphosis</I>, book 1). He is the son of
Prometheus (whom we could compare to Cain and his descendance, the
generation of metal workers, masters of high temperatures: compare to
the stories surrounding the metal workers of West Africa). Zeus
floods the earth in anger at the sins of the age of bronze. One of
the sins may be compared to that of Cain: Lycaon has offered human
flesh as divine meal, triggering the gods' anger. But Deucalion and
Pyrrha, advised by Prometheus, built a box ( <I>larnax</I> in Greek)
in which they spend 9 days and nights. On land again, they repopulate
the earth by casting stones (ST A 1245). Deucalion's son is Hellen (
which is parallel to Japhet). Deucalion is considered to be the
founder of the temple of olympian Zeus in Athens (and responsible for
starting the sacrificial system there? the founding of cities, temple
= house of the divinity, ordinary houses, demanded the proper
sacrifice). Notice that Prometheus is a fire-bearer, and his son
stars in the flood. The spirit of this story circulating in the
Greek-speaking areas is closer to that of the biblical story. The
reason for punishment is similar (though the struggle between the
humans and the gods is closer to the Mesopotamian myths). All the
stories are concerned with population and proper "devotion" (the
sacrifices of animals), or proper devotion to the gods, associated by
the story world itself to the iron age.</P>

<P>N.B. the original chaos is liquid (Tiamat or her remnant Tehom in
the Hebrew text, now in Noah's saga), but the final catastrophe is
imagined as a fiery, volcanic consumption of the universe.</P>

<H3>Historical reading of the Flood and Babel stories</H3>

<P>We know something of the context of some of the writers, namely
the so-called P tradition or group of documents. The exile to Babylon
in 587 or 586 of the Jerusalem king and aristocracy, including the
priests, was lived as a collapse of order: cultic places, control
over land, self-sustainability and independence of society,
hierarchical relationships, the power of national god(s), everything
was questioned and thrown in turmoil by this event. It is expressed
in the prophets and Psalms as a flood, waters engulfing the land.</P>

<P>The Torah or Hebrew traditions became the cement or bond for the
people, with claims (including the prophetic rewriting) regarding the
people which became a fundamental part of the Judaeans'
consciousness. These are some of the conditions of the appearance of
P, between 550 and 450bce.</P>

<P>Our flood story can therefore be read as a prefiguration, or a
type, of what is to come later, repeatedly, but is already known to
the writers.</P>

<P>Having lost their land &emdash;and this for a long time, until the
Hasmonean revolution, 164 to 63 bce, when the Romans make their
presence felt&emdash;, after their returns between 538 and 450 bce,
but still under foreign imperial domination (Mede, Persian, later
Macedonian), the writers interpret their survival in new terms.
Theirs is a land from which they were expelled, and yet it remains a
promised land.</P>

<H3>Other readings</H3>

<P>a) <I>typological readings</I>:</P>
    <ol>
        <li>Christian: the Great Flood is seen as a prefiguration of
baptism; or a prefiguration of Jesus' (Christ) resurrection from the
dead; both these interpretations are merged and become part of
allegorical readings (in which each element of the Noachic story is
seen as corresponding to an element of Jesus' life or to the
Christian life).</li>
        <li>Historical (i.e., applied to historical situations).</li>
    </ol>
<P>b) <I>Psychoanalytical interpretation</I>:</P>

<P>A sort of dream, perhaps a urinary dream even, or the fantasy of
being born. The ark would be the maternal womb. We would be
witnessing a new birth from the primordial mother, the ark being a
device used by the God-father caring for the abandoned child?? The
result would be a new individual severed from normal genealogies (as
the survivor of Melville's Moby Dick?), from a purely biological
line. This would be especially important in ideologies of royalty. Or
in Jungian terms: the flood is our own dangerous unconscious, yet
also a source of regeneration. Noah would be the individual who
builds his "new" personhood (the ark) on the surface of a flood which
removes all previous connections (genealogies of chapter 5),
kinships, even landscapes.</P>
