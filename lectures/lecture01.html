<H3>Early transmission of the biblical text</H3>

<UL>
    
    <LI>The goal of the class is to help students read the book of Genesis in a
    historical manner. To "read" these texts as literature means to use the
    kind of techniques used in reading other literary works and think of the
    Bible as a synchronic text, all of it potentially cross-referential.
    Historical criticism, in quite a different way, purports to separate
    various traditions and texts and discover their origins in a particular
    historical situation.</LI>
   
    <LI>It is important to know some of the historical circumstances
    surrounding the creation of the biblical text and its transmission in order
    to appreciate the text even more fully, including as a theological
    work.</LI>
   
    <LI>Origin and transmission of the text: laws gathered at different times,
    from the time of the early monarchy; chronicles; psalms and bits of epic;
    greater and more sustained narratives put together at the time of the exile
    (sixth century before our era).</LI>
   
    <LI>From the Hebrew text (with some Aramaic in Ezra-Nehemiah and Daniel) to
    the Septuagint in Greek: the Hebrew Torah part, having a status of its own
    by the time of the Persian period (–538 to –333), was the first document
    translated into Greek, probably in the third century bce. This Greek text
    (eventually called the Septuagint or LXX) gave its own interpretation of
    the Hebrew text. Other interpretations were eventually needed by
    Aramaic-speaking Jewish communities. These versions and paraphrases in
    Aramaic are called Targums (targumim).</LI>
   
    <LI>With Christianity, the Greek text was translated into other languages:
    Latin, Syriac, Ethiopian languages, Armenian etc. But Christian
    intellectuals like Origen (185-254) and especially Jerome (342-420) knew
    that it was essential to know the Hebrew text and its components in order
    to have a reliable text in either Greek or Latin. Jerome translated the
    Hebrew books into the most widely used Latin version, called the
    "Vulgate".</LI>
   
    <LI>Within the Jewish communities of the Diaspora and Palestine, there was
    a movement away from the then-received Greek text, because of its
    cooptation by Christians, and other Greek translations were produced
    (for instance Aquila, ca. 140ce).</LI>

<H3>How to call the Bible and its parts</H3>

<ul> 
    
    <li><I>"Bible"</I>: from <I>ta biblia</I>, "the little books", which has
    given "the Bible".</li>
    
    <li><i>"Torah"</i>: a Hebrew word meaning "teaching" but also "law", though
    not with our meaning.</li>
    
    <li><I>"Tanakh"</I>: a modern Jewish appellation, an acronym of <I>"torah,
    nevi'im, ketuvim"</I>, i.e. of the three main divisions of the Bible for
    Jews: Torah, Prophets (including Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings), and
    Writings (Wisdom, Job, Psalms, etc.).</li>
    
    <li>Scripture or<I> "Miqra'"</I>: another more traditional Jewish
    appellation, meaning "reading", "what is read".</li>
    
    <li><I>Old Testament and New Testament</I>: Christian names, to be used
    when a Christian interpretation is meant. The name <I>"testament"</I> comes
    from Latin <I>"testamentum"</I>, itself from Greek <I>diatheke</I>, whose
    secondary meaning was "covenant" or "compact", which fitted Hebrew
    <I>berith</I>, but whose common meaning was "will, testament". This Greek
    translation of Hebrew <I>berith</I> happened much before Christianity
    arose. The word occurs several hundred times in the Bible.</li>
