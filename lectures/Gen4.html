<H2>Cain and Abel</H2>

<h3>General remarks on Genesis 4</h3>

<P>After the differentiations that happened in Gen 1 and 2-3, the story of Cain
and Abel marks a new level of separation, though the verb <I>lehavdil</I> ("to
separate") is not used here. It is a new kind of separation, after that of the
elements and that of the original human pair (from itself, and from the blessed
land / garden).</P>

<P>The reason for the first murder is given as a jealousy triggered by the
preference shown by the divine agent. But three other elements are present in
the story which, though not overtly given as causes for the outbreak of
violence, are perhaps more significant and were surely understood by ancient
audiences as fundamental background, because they constituted part of the life
of ancient agricultural societies in the Levant.</P>

<P>(1) In the first place, ancient audiences must have read into the roles of
Cain and Abel, one the sedentary farmer and the other a herder, the
representation of a conflict very familiar to them between sedentary farming
and nomadic or semi-nomadic herding, or simply between the demands of farming
and those of herding. This tension took many forms in antiquity and appears in
many texts. In fact, both farming and herding need each other. Farming provides
grain-based food, richer pastures, protection, other types of goods, while
herding provides manuring, meat, leather and wool, all essential goods for
settled agricultural society. Note that the modern notion of the "good
shepherd" and the peace associated with shepherding is itself deeply influenced
by other biblical stories such as are found in the book of Isaiah or the psalms
and most importantly in the gospels.</P>

<P>(2) In the second place, as in the Roman story of a strife between Remus and
Romulus, this jealousy is related to the foundation of first cities and the
establishment of civilization. In our text, this aspect is a little less
evident but nonetheless clear. Three features in the text are related to this
idea of fratricidal violence as basic to civilization, by which is meant first
and foremost the world of cities. The first is the idea of retaliation and
markers for levels of retaliation in Gen 4.15 and further in 4.24. Secondly, in
Gen 4.17, Cain engenders Henoch, whose name means "founding" and who is a "city
builder." Thirdly, the rest of the genealogy in Gen 4, among the children of
Lamech, mixes nomadic people and city-based people, recognizable as metal
workers (Yuval, Tuval-Qain). The march to civilization (building and the
metallurgy needed for weapons as well as tools or music instruments) is
predicated, seems to say the text, on increasing violence. Strangely enough,
Cain's punishment is to become a wanderer (<I>na` wanad</I> "on the move," in
4.12)</P>

<P>(3) Another important thing to bear in mind when thinking about this story
is that it is presented as the "first" of several stories of brotherly rivalry.
Think of Esau and Jacob, Joseph and his brothers, Aaron and Moses to some
degree, David and his elder brothers in the story about Goliath, the struggle
for royal title among David's own children. Even though first in the biblical
text, the tale of Cain's fratricide should be read in the context of these
other accounts of brotherly struggles. In these stories, a/the younger brother
is shown to inherit name and power, after some form of potentially murderous
struggle. But the outcome of our Cain / Abel story is atypical, in that the
younger brother is killed and the elder one survives. These stories come from a
culture in which to be the elder male in fact meant more power, inheritance,
and fame. Why the reader is led to think that the younger one is in the right
may not be due simply to poetic licence or pure effects of the imagination but
real historical issues confronted more than once by Israelites and Judaeans in
their struggle for independence.</P>

<P>About the divine character so far: ommipotent in Gen 1, much closer to the
humans in Gen 3 as well as perhaps not totally in control and expressing worry
or concern. But we are left at the end of Gen 3 with the image of a powerful
god again. In Gen 4, divine will appears awsomely free again (some might say
capricious), but also concerned more clearly than in Gen 2-3 with right
behavior on the part of humans. God is speaking directly to all in the clear of
day, not at night, in dreams, or through agents.</P>

<P>The first couple and their children live in a vegetarian world. The text
speaks of "offerings," but not of sacrifices (sacrifices for sin, holocausts,
and the like, which appear in Exodus, Leviticus, etc.). I hope to show you the
theory of sacrifice proposed by René Girard (<I>Violence and the
Sacred</I>). He suggests that basic to humans is a potential for mimetic desire
which, if not mediated by such institutions as sacrifices (as in antiquity) or
other religious devices, leads to uncontrollable violence. In the present
story, the presence of animals on Abel's side is interesting from this point of
view of sacrifice, even though one will have to wait until the story of Noah to
see the first such sacrificial act. Animals were capital, and as capital today,
were the most visible form of wealth and social differentiation. Moreover,
animals required great care, long hours of work, and were close to people. They
also created tension between farmers (and farmers and shepherds) because they
could be destructive. Sacrifice, in a farming society, was a substitutive way
to diffuse tension by making a victim to the divinity out of a prized animal,
share in the ceremony and often also in the following meal.</P>

<h3>Notes on the text</h3>
   
   <P>4.1 "and the man knew Eve...": some translations have "Adam," but Adam, a
   personal name when given without article, appears only a little later, in
   4.25, after the first murder, and the first genealogy. Note of grammar: In
   the Hebrew sentence as we have it, the order "and + subject + verb in the
   perfect" (<I>we-ha-adam yada` hawah ...</I>) should normally lead one to
   translate the verb as a pluperfect, i.e., "and the man had known Eve...,"
   which would imply that conception would have taken place in the garden
   planted in Eden. This is the meaning suggested by Rashi and adopted by
   certain translations on good linguistic grounds. "Know" in Hebrew also means
   to have sexual relations. "She conceived and bore" is a formula not
   completely repeated in 4.25: it is a formula often used in the Hebrew Bible
   for the first born.</P>
   
   <P>The name of Cain is significant. It is connected in the text itself to
   "acquisition", as indeed the verb <I>qanah</I> may denote the notion of
   acquisition, to obtain (in property). It also may denote the idea of
   creation. Eve's "I acquired a man (or: I created a man) from (with) God"
   seems very boastful.</P>
   
   <P>4.2 The name Abel is not explained directly in the text, but may mean
   something like a "vapor," something transitory, not very consistent. Cain
   works the "soil" which has just been cursed and is to be thought of as
   producing very little in return for much labor.</P>
   
   <P>4.3 "Offering:" <I>minḥah</I>, cultic language of offering. Since the
   ground has been cursed, should one think that Cain's offering is deficient
   by nature?</P>
   
   <P>4.4 Same language of "offering" for Abel. Abel offers choice animals and
   "from their fat." Clearly a better offering than Cain's.</P>
   
   <P>4.5 The Lord God is not favorable to Cain or his offering. This is the
   first of several stories in which God's choice is puzzling and unexplained.
   Tradition fills in the blanks with various explanations.</P>
   
   <P>4.7 "Sin crouching, and towards you is its desire:" same language as in
   3.16.</P>
   
   <P>4.8 "and he spoke:" What did Cain say to his brother? Traditional midrash
   fills in the blanks in various ways. "...in the field:" away from everyone,
   in a desolate area.</P>
   
   <P>4.9 "Where is Abel your brother?" A question similar to that of 3.9 to
   Adam. In replying that he is not his brother's guardian, Cain is rejecting
   the language of guardianship used by God in ch. 2-3.</P>
   
   <P>4.10 "the voice of the blood of your brother cries unto me from the
   ground:" The words "blood" and "ground" have a common root, the color "red"
   (<I>êdom</I>).</P>
   
   <P>4.11 Now it is Cain himself who is cursed, not only the ground as in
   3.17. The soil is personalized, with a mouth, and perhaps monster-like in
   its capacity to absorb spilled blood which cannot be recognized because of
   its similar color.</P>
   
   <P>4.14 "you exiled me:" the same word as in 3.24: to expell or exile. This
   word has echoes of the catastrophic exiles which occurred to both the
   northern kingdom of Israel (in 722 bce) and the smaller kingdom of Juda (in
   586 bce). The Deuteronomistic history and prophetic tradition considered
   that God used the enemies of Israel/ Judah as agents of punishment. This is
   how ancient Israelites and Judaeans made sense of what happened to them in
   history. The stories of expulsion of the first couple and Cain are written
   or re-written with these tragic events in mind. The direction of these
   historical exiles to Assyria and Babylonia was eastward, as seen from the
   historical home of Israel / Juda.</P>
   
   <P>4.16 The land of Nod ("Nod" sounds like "nad") refers to a land of
   nomads, east of Eden.</P>
   
   <P>4.17-26 an interesting genealogy: counting Adam and Eve, one has eight
   generations. The following genealogy in ch. 5 counts ten generations from
   Adam / Eve to Noah, but eight generations from Enosh (which means "man"
   also, and who has a special relationship to God, like Adam / Eve) to
   Noah.</P>
   
   <P>5.21-25 Enoch lives 365 years, the (almost) right number of days for a
   solar year. "Enoch" means "founding" (same root as for Hanukkah,
   "foundation").</P>
