<H2>Jacob and Joseph, or fathers and sons in the Bible</H2>

<P>Where is the divinity in this story? Now there is a more distant mechanism,
something called divine providence.</P>

<P>Notice that Joseph has dreams whereas Jacob has "visions at night"
(46.2).</P>

<P>Joseph is the younger brother, but not the youngest, since there is
Benjamin, like him son of Rachel.</P>

<P>37.2: He is telling on his brothers, or rather on a particular set of his
brothers, "the sons of Bilha and Zilpa." What is their reputation? Do they go
stealing from their "father" (such as sacrificing a goat here and there?). Or
when they are "out in the field," leading the flocks, do they go brutalizing
people (women?) around? They are the sons of slave women: do they expect to be
pushed aside by the other brothers, especially by Rachel's sons, since Rachel
is the favored wife? They are in the situation of Ishmael, sacrificed by the
system of inheritance, or at least this is how they see it?</P>

<P>37.3: "Son of his old age:" this would suit Benjamin better. The sign of
Jacob's favoritism (image of Rebecca's favoritism of Jacob) is the coat with
sleeves, or many colored (with Greek, but Aquila perhaps had "[going to] the
ankles") (cf. the seamless tunic of Jesus in the story of the passion). This
coat, say some targumim and midrashim, is the original clothing given by the
divinity to Adam/ Eve (what of Eve's set in the commentaries, however?
Disappeared, "faute de besoin?"). There are speculations about Joseph's role as
a prefiguration of the suffering messiah, as different, but paired with, the
son of David, the triumphant messiah.</P>

<P>37.5-11: Dreams... regarding brothers and family, on earth and
in the skies.</P>

<P>37.11: His father kept this in his heart: cf. Lk 2.51, which is also a story
of reversals. Does he realize the intensity of the jealousy, or is he blind to
it (as blind as his father Isaac, and forgetful of his own struggles in his
youth)?</P>

<P>37.12ff.: Why does Jacob send Joseph to check on the other ten brothers?
Also to check on them perhaps: after all, he is the <I>first</I> son of Rachel,
the beloved or chosen wife, whereas eight of the brothers are by Leah, her
servant, or Rachel's servant. If there is competition between the wives or
substitute wives, as the Bible clearly says, one may suspect that the jealousy
between brothers or groups of brothers is even keener because more
vicarious.</P>

<P>37.12: Sichem: in the northern mountain massif, about 3 days walk from
Hebron, which is at the southern tip of the mountain region.</P>

<P>37.13: Are the brothers hungry and waiting for special food from home (fresh
pita; fruit perhaps; virgin olive oil; perhaps wine?). They eat &#133;. Joseph?
not quite, says the story.</P>

<P>Note for comparison the gospel parable in which a king/master sends his son
to the tenants (Mt 21, Mk 12, Lk 20). Compare also with the Talmud stories
about a son being sent to workers or tenants to manage them and who is asked by
workers to feed them as the master doesn't seem to be coming to "feed" them.
The son does it, by praying God for a miracle and obtaining fruit "out of
season." But it is at his own risk of being himself "harvested out of season,"
a judgment cast by the father who finally arrives]</P>

<P>Midrash Rabbah on Gen 37.13:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      <I>And he said to him: Here am I.</I> R.
      Hama b. R. Hanina said: Our ancestor [Jacob] was ever
      mindful of these words and was consumed with remorse. 'I knew
      that thy brethren hate thee, and yet thou didst answer me: Here
      am I.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>My own reading, in view of the story of Abraham and Isaac, the
<I>hinneni</I>, the fact that Jacob was aware of the brothers' hate, and also
that he immediately will go into mourning, goes along with the midrashic
interpretation. But the midrash adds, cautiously, that Jacob foresaw the events
(see Gen 37.11), and was also willing (as Joseph was apparently, rash young
thing he was) to fulfill the "deep designs" of the Holy One....</P>

<P>In vss. 12ff., all the brothers are involved, not only Bilha's and Zilpa's
sons, but the story is told from two different angles: paternal preference
leads to thoughts of murder, stopped by Juda who advises selling to
Ishmaelites; or the outlandish dreams lead to same murderous thoughts, blocked
by Reuben, after he has been sold to passing Midianites. One standard
explanation is that the J and E documents or traditions (De Vaux) have been
mixed, so well mixed in fact that several scholars question the usefulness of
the documentary hypothesis.</P>

<P>One can read the seemingly contradictory stories as one: Judah, by selling
Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 shekels of silver, is spiting Reuben, the
older son (Judah is the younger son of the first set of sons by Leah), who is
trying to save Joseph. Judah has his own agenda.</P>

<P>37.25: Notice the meal of the brothers: it is once expressed, but implied
the second time.</P>

<P>37.31-33: Joseph's tunic dipped in the blood of a he-goat (<I>se`ir
`izzim</I>; but see Greek versions which understand "kid"). Jacob will be
fooled by a goat's blood, a revisiting of his own tricks. Does he understand
what has happened and play the fool?</P>
