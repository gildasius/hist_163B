<h2>Genesis 1-11: Myth, saga, or
history?</h2>

<P>What makes human groups reach for a mythical account as drama? The story of
Genesis, about creation of the earth, the first human beings, their place in
the world, is not told as allegory but as a story often called a myth. An
allegory would be explainable, it could be "unpacked" and each element of it
assigned a meaning. But a myth can be opened and explored, without bringing it
to a closure. There is a residue of meaning.</P>

<P>This drama provides answers to some important questions: What is the origin
of the world? How does it work? What is the role of human beings in it? The
drama in the Biblical story of Genesis consists of an evolution from something
like perfection or a sort of innocence at the beginning, through an
inadequation or a fall, to some form of recovery.</P>

<P>But is it a myth such as we apprehend the Mesopotamian or Greek accounts of
creation to be (<I>Enuma Elish</I> and Hesiod's <I>Theogony</I>)? In calling it
a myth, at issue are views of historical destiny, choice of society, and more
widely meaning of human existence.</P>

<P>"The Scripture stories do not, like Homer's, court our favor, they do not
flatter us that they may please us and enchant us â€”; they seek to subject us,
and if we refuse to be subjected we are rebels." (Erich Auerbach.
<I>Mimesis</I>. Transl. W.R. Trask. Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1953, p. 15)</P>

<P><B>Arguments against calling it a myth</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>The godhead is singular, though the form of the name used in
   Gen 1 is masculine plural (elohim).</LI>
   
   <LI>There is no genesis of the godhead, no birth of the parts of
   the universe personalized in myths as gods and goddesses (in our
   story, Heavens, Earth, Abyss or Chaos, Day, Night, Sun and Moon
   are not gods and not engendered. They are made).</LI>
   
   <LI>No cosmic struggle (theomachy) between the generations of the
   gods as in Enuma Elish or the Theogony. Just a hint of it perhaps
   in the chaotic aspect of the beginning.</LI>
   
   <LI>No paredra for the godhead. Elohim doesn't have a goddess
   sitting by him.</LI>
   
   <LI>No glorification of a Marduk-like figure, no exalting not only of gods
   but of the idea of kingship.
   
   <LI>No Prometheus-like story in which a heroic human outsmarts the
   gods. Unless one thinks of the serpent as this smart figure?</LI>
   
   <LI>The humans are not condemned to serve the gods. Humanity is created with
   another purpose in mind. In the second story, however, there is a punishment
   for a fault.</LI>
   
   <LI>The story is not presented as a Muse-inspired song, although
   many think of the first chapter as poetic, because of the
   repetitions ("And God said," ten times; "it was good," seven
   times; "he blessed," three times).</LI>
   
   <LI>The story is not proposed as closed onto itself, but it opens
   to the history of the universe and its peoples, quickly narrowing
   down to the history of Abraham's family, and eventually the story
   of Jacob (another name for Israel). The story of Israel continues
   in the book of Exodus, then through the story of the settlement in
   the promised land, and finally the story of the kings which end
   tragically in a most historical episode of Israel's history, the
   exile to Assyria (721 bce) and to Babylon (586 bce). The story is
   rewritten, edited, and arranged in view of this last event, by
   people who have lost their political independence and are
   reflecting upon that loss.</LI>
