<H3>Notes on geography and history of Israel / the Levant</H3>
    <ol>
        <li>General conditions: See May's atlas for maps showing the rainfall
        distribution and the relationship of Palestine to neighboring regions,
        Mesopotamia and Egypt. Grain could be easily grown on the coastal
        plain, down to the isohyet of 400mm of rain, and we find the richer
        cultures of the Philistines and the Phoenicians indeed to the south and
        the north of this richer coastal plain.

        More rain falls in the hill country than on the coast, because the
        hill massif rises to between 1000 and 2000 feet. The Judah and Israel
        mountains (or hills) were more densely wooded and had more soil cover
        in antiquity than presently. A progressively more intense agriculture
        (in dry farming style) and systematic pasturing have caused the slow
        erosion of the slopes and the washing down of soils to valley
        floors.</BR> 
            Very little rain fell to the east of these hills and the
        harsh desert of Judah provided both an area of defense and passage. At
        the foothill of the Judah and Israel mountains in the Jordan valley
        (the Ghor, below sea level), there are several oases with permanent
        water spring or streams, the most famous and most ancient of which is
        Jericho. To the east of the Jordan river, another fairly well-watered
        plateau rises to about 1000-1500 feet, and sustains permanent
        agriculture. Its northern part was occupied in antiquity by Israelites
        and other people.</li>

        <li>The name used to describe the region is usually "Palestine" (from
        "Peleshet", referring to the coastal area occupied by Philistines and
        other peoples): it appears for instance in Herodotus. The name
        "Palestine" becomes an official name only during the Roman Empire,
        after the Bar Kokhba's revolt of 132-35ce.<BR> The name Israel, another
        name given to Jacob in Genesis, appears for the first time in the 13th
        c. bce on the Merneptah stela (see below), referring to the central
        hill area,whereas Canaan refers to the lowland areas, i.e. the coastal
        plains. It was the name used for the early monarchy, i.e. about 50
        years in the 10th c. bce, and was then the name of the northern
        kingdom, until 721bce (corresponding to later Samaria).<BR> The name
        Holy Land is a devotional name.</li>

        <li>Israel appears on the historical scene (meaning in the historical
        record) in the Iron Age period, at the same time as the Philistines,
        and a little later than the Phoenicians. It is interesting and
        surprising that the biblical tradition does not mention the
        overwhelming presence of Egypt in Palestine during the Bronze Age,
        until the Iron Age and the arrival of the Sea Peoples. The Philistines
        (and Sea Peoples who appeared in the area in the 13th c. bce) brought
        new war techniques (including the use of iron) which gave them a
        political superiority for a long while. Israel was a settled, farming
        people, growing grain, oil, wine, and other necessities. Archaeology
        has discovered a dense network of villages, especially in the northern
        part of the hills, and walled cities or towns (small, none bigger than
        a football stadium). It is difficult, however, to assign archaeological
        remains to "Israelite" people rather than "Canaanite" of one stripe or
        another. The role of defense and military organization was important in
        all of these societies.</li>

        <li>Ancient Israelite society was organized, like many other
        dry-farming societies known around the world, in a loose way around
        councils of elders. If there was a monarchy, it may have been fairly
        weak, and the Davidic monarchy should not conjure ideas of a regime
        imposing its iron rule from Beersheva to northern Dan. The tribal
        phenomenon may be quite late rather than at the origin of Israel, as
        the Bible portrays it.</li>

        <li>The cult would have been a polytheism until at least the period of
        the exile to Babylon. Archaeology has revealed thousands of home
        statuettes of deities, especially female, and the biblical text also
        keeps traces of this kind of beliefs. Monotheism, or rather henotheism,
        i.e. the belief in a one god for one people, not excluding other gods
        for other peoples (i.e. without universal claims), appears to be a
        later development, in the exilic or post-exilic period.</li>

        <li>Writing appeared in the Iron Age also among Semitic people, first
        in the coastal area. It's only in the exilic period or very shortly
        before (6th c. bce) that something like what we call the Torah or the
        Pentateuch comes into existence, containing especially collections of
        cultic and community laws. The layers separated in the documentary
        hypothesis (systematized and brilliantly expounded by Wellhausen at the
        end of the XIXth c.), namely J (Yahwist), E (Elohist), D
        (Deuteronomist: characterized by a particular view of the history of
        Israel), and P (Priestly: concerned with the temple cult and calendar),
        cannot easily be separated and dated, in spite of the great many
        efforts spent to do so.</li>
    </ol>
        

<H3>Events significant for an understanding of the biblical 
  text</H3>
  <ol>
      <li>Prior to 1200bce: Very little known. Nothing is known about Abraham apart from the story in Genesis. In spite of this total absence of evidence, the Abraham saga is often dated to about –1750bce. There is no external information either of Moses or of an exodus of Hebrew people from Egypt. These “events” are traditionally dated to sometime around the mid 13th century bce. Egypt actually dominated Palestine in this period but lost its power after –1200.</li>

      <li>1200bce and after: Iron Age period, which is characterized in Palestine by new developments in agriculture, settlement distribution, warfare. Philistines seem to have the upper hand in the area, from their location in the southern coastal plain where their five cities were surrounded by an extensive village system. Writing did spread slowly at the time, especially after –900.</BR> 
      It is difficult, if not impossible, to isolate the ancient Hebrews from other populations in Palestine (Canaanites, Philistines, Phoenicians in the North), on the basis of the archaeological record alone. Most histories of ancient Israel tend to follow the Biblical text, as critically as possible, with an eye to extra-textual evidence, but still remain within the compass of the text. The earliest external mention of Israel is the Merneptah stela from Egypt (Merneptah's dates: 1212-1202bce), in which this pharaoh gives the list of peoples he has subjugated, including Israel. From the context, Israel appears to be then a settled people in the central hill area of Palestine, and Canaan seems to refer to the people in the coastal area.</li>

      <li>The next external mention is found in the stela of Mesha, king of Moab (ca. 850bce), a grain-growing plateau east of the Dead Sea. Very recently (in 1992?), the archaeologists working at Tell Dan, a large ancient city at the foot of the Hermon near the Jordan's springs, have unearthed an inscription from about the same period as Mesha's, in which a Syrian king claims he has subjugated someone belonging to the "house of David". There is some dispute as to the proper interpretation of the expression, however, fueled by recent attempts to write a history of ancient Israel which would be independent from the biblical accounts.</li>

      <li>10th and 9th c. BCE: Development of Israelite monarchy: Saul, David, Solomon. How much power did those kings really have is in dispute: were they more than local chieftains?</li>

      <li>950bce: The schism between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah</li>

      <li>721bce: Conquest of northern Israel by Assyrian and exile to Nineveh.</li>

      <li>587 (586)bce: Conquest of southern Judah by the Babylonians, exile to Babylone of the aristocracy, especially the priests, though not all (pronounced "Bavel" in Hebrew, i.e. Babel or Babylone: "bab-el", gate of the god El, or gate to its temple; but the word also sounds like "balbel", "le-valbel" in Hebrew, to speak non-sense. This sort of pun is close to the one made by Greek people when speaking of populations unable to speak Greek: they are "barbaroi", i.e. barbars, people who speak non-sensically, "bar-bar" or "bal-bal".)</li>

      <li>538 A new form of kingdom over Babylon: the Persian king Cyrus, who allows the exiled community to return to Judah and rebuild the Jerusalem Temple as a central place for the cult of "Yahweh". Period of great literary activity, including the final editing of the major parts of the Hebrew Bible as it is presently known, in its main lines.</li>

      <li>322 Beginning of the so-called Hellenistic period. Alexander conquers the whole Near East, including Egypt and Persia. Alexander's successors dispute the inheritance: the Ptolemies of Egypt rule over Palestine until 200bce, followed by the Seleucids from Syria.</li>

      <li>166-64 Maccabean revolt and the beginning of a local Judahite Hasmonean dynasty.</li>

      <li>63 First Roman intervention in Palestine, followed by the eventual setting up of client-kings among whom Herod the Great.</li>
