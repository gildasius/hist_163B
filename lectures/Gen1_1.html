<H2>Genesis
1.1-3.24</H2>

<P>1.1: <U>bere'shit</U>: in <U>a</U> beginning, not in <U>the</U>
beginning. The LXX is in agreeement: Greek <U>en arkhê</U> is
unarticulated (without an article). “Created...” = <U>bara'</U>, or is it a present participle,
<U>bero'</U>, or <U>briya't</U> (Rashi), and we should translate the first three verses as one long sentence? Notice that the verb <em>bara'</em>
reappears at the end of the first story, "<U>bara' elohim
la`asot</U>" an expression in which <em>bara'</em> is used as an auxiliary
verb, conveying an intention. This
verb <U>bara'</U> is used exclusively of the divinity in the Bible, and especially in texts known to have been written by priests.
So perhaps this "intention" can be read back in 1.1 and <em>bara'</em> perhaps
translated as "conceived." According to Gilboa, the scholar who proposed this notion, the idea was that there would be an
omnipotent creator in the first verse, but that this power fades
away, becoming a doing or manipulation, while giving more power to
human creatures. There are other ways to explain this variety. In Gen 1, the deity's speaking is at times sufficient for things to exist (light, for instance). At other times, it creates (<em>bara'</em>) or makes (root <em>`asah</em>). And finally, the earth seems to produce vegetation on its own. At the end of this verse: "day one," not "first
day:" because there is no series yet? Or something examplary and unrepeatable in a series happened on that day? But there was "a beginning" of
sorts, since all stories need a "once upon a time."</P>

<P>To conclude this note: the syntax can be read in the same manner as the
long, winding style of 2.4a-7. It can also be read---as it is
traditionally---as a series of short declarations.</P>

<P>1.1-2.4a Time is the category which is most emphasized in this
text, whereas space is left undefined. In 2.4b-3, on the contrary,
space is the all-important category: details are given on the area
and on directions.</P>

<P>1.2 <U>weha'arets haytah</U><I>...</I> : "and the earth had been...":
when God set out to create the skies and the earth, the earth <U>had been</U>
in a state of chaos. This is assuming that a pluperfect is needed here because
the <I>vav conversivus</I> attached here to the subject of the verb in the
perfect demands this nuance. If a <I>vav</I> is followed by a noun subject, the
following verb in the perfect is normally construed as a pluperfect. No notion
of a <U>creatio ex nihilo</U> can be derived from this passage.

<P><U>tohu wa-vohu</U>: there is little chaos in this story, compared
to most myths. The story insists on order. In any case, chaos is not personalized and deified, on the contrary.</P>

<P><U>yishretsu ha-mmayyim</U>, "let the waters teem" (Speiser), not
"let the waters bring forth," because this is not a <U>hif`il</U>,
not a causative. The waters are simply a locus for this "teeming" or
multiplication.</P>

<P>Note the use of <U>bara'</U> and <U>`asah</U>: difference
in originality, and a concern about hierarchy?</P>

<P>[1.26-7 <U>betsalmeynu ki-dmuteynu</U> and "<U>betselem</U>"
(name of a humanitarian organization in Israel).</P>

<P>Human male/female, that is the whole of humankind, in the image
(statue-like) of God, but of a god who, as we learn later, cannot be
represented, or even properly named.</P>

<P>2.1-3 are convoluted sentences ending the first account of
creation. The last sentence on the blessing and sanctification by God
(what does sanctifying mean here?) of Sabbath ends with a strange
insistence on the work accomplished (3 different verbs), and the act
of resting. In the cult of Israel as we know it from the books of
Exodus and Leviticus as well as from historical sources, the cult
will involve a special kind of work on the seventh day, the day of
rest. The word used will be `<U>avodah</U>, usually translated as
"cult," "service."</P>

<P>Note that the Samaritan version has a 6<SUP>th</SUP> day instead
of 7<SUP>th</SUP> day.</P>

<P>2.4a is thought to be part of the first account, perhaps because
of its use of the "<U>bara</U>" verb. But it is strange that it
speaks of "<U>toledot</U>" which, however one translates this word,
refers to generations, while the first story actually insists so much
on the making, shaping, and considers "generation" only in regard to
seeds, fruit, animals and human beings.</P>

<P>2.4b the second story of creation starts with new vocabulary, a
world already there, but lacking crucial things (in contradisdinction
with the picture of the world we gather from the first story). It
lacks shrubbery and grass, rain, and human labor. This seems closer
to the Mesopotamian stories we have seen.</P>

<P>God's name is different: <U>yahweh elohim</U>, translated as the
Lord God. Note that since antiquity this first name of god is treated
with special regard in writing and in speaking: in ancient mss,
Hebrew or Greek, the tetragrammaton often appears in palaeohebrew. In
reading the bible, one avoids pronouncing this name in various ways
(<U>adonay</U>, the "name").</P>

<P>2.7 <U>yitser yahweh elohim et-ha adam, `afar min ha-adamah</U>...
the verb is that used of a potter shaping a ball of clay, "forming."
The word for "man" is <U>adam</U> but is prefaced by the article
"the." <U>Adam</U> is not a proper name yet. He is dust from the
soil. <U>Adamah</U>, soil, is a word in a family of words having the
color "red" (<U>adom</U>) in common. Another word from this family,
<U>edom</U>, will appear soon in the book of Genesis and name a
war-like (red like blood?) people living south of historical
Israel.</P>

<P>2.8 a garden is planted in Eden, East (of it?), or just generally
East: a garden in a place or plain called Eden? So Eden is a
geographical name, for a place larger than the garden (cf. Speiser)..
Later, man and woman are expelled further East. Recall that in
historical times, Israelites from the northern kingdom of Israel will
be exiled to Mesopotamia by Assyrians, and Judahites later on, in
586bce, will be exiled in turn to Babylonia by the Babylonians (soon
replaced by other empires).</P>

<P>2.9 all sorts of trees desirable to sight and good to eat, and the
tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge
of everything (where? it doesn't say). The story is reflecting on the
origins of desire, which comes by the eye ("evil eye" and desire to
eat). The "<U>qol</U>" or voice of the Lord God lacks the power of
the senses of sight and taste.</P>

<P>Why are the humans drawn to the tree of knowledge rather than to
the other one?</P>

<P>2.10-15 difficult passage on the geography of Eden: four rivers,
precious stones (compare to the <I>Epic of Gilgamesh</I>). It is an
irrigation scheme: a river goes out of Eden to irrigate the garden,
and separates into 4 branches: Pishon (the gold region, + other
precious stones), Gihon (region of Kush, but Gihon is the name of a
spring in Jerusalem), Hiddeqel east of Ashur, and the Euphrates is
the fourth one. The adam (or "earth extract," earthling, which is
also the notion at the root of the word "human," from Latin
<U>homo</U>, related to <U>humus</U>, earth or soil) is set in the
garden (f.) to work and guard/preserve it.</P>

<P>2.16-17 eating from all the trees ordered, eating from the tree of
knowledge forbidden, because "the day you eat of it, you will
certainly die."</P>

<P>2.18-24 Creation of Eve, as a helper "against him" (for him? the
idea is of support). So, in a way which reminds the reader again of
Mesopotamian myths, God shapes (<U>yetser</U>. Meaning, form,
purpose, imagination, instinct) animals out of clay/<U>adamah</U>.
This activity is that of a potter, who shapes and make images. But
none of the creatures presented to the first human figure quite makes
the cut. They are simply recognized by "the adam" as "animals," and
named as such. So, sleep is induced in the human person (deep sleep)
and one of the ribs "built" (different verb: <U>wayiven</U>, source
of puns on 'son', <U>ben</U>, at least later on) into "woman"
(<U>ishah</U>), whose name is explained as an extraction from "man" =
"<U>ish</U>" in Hebrew. It is actually an addition, since the same
"-<U>ah</U>" sound which had been removed from <U>adamah</U> (soil)
to make <U>adam</U> (human being) is added at the end of the word.
Then explanation of marriage unit, as a "gluing", one flesh.</P>

<P>Rashi, followed by many Jewish exegetes, will read "took one of
his sides," rather than "one of his ribs", and keeps to the notion of
woman as "facing helper", by virtue of knowing Hebrew:
<U>kenegdo</U>.</P>

<P>2.25 They were naked and didn't feel shame. `<U>arum</U>, which
means "naked" here, comes perhaps from the word for "skin" (hebrew
<U>`or</U>). They are naked and not aware, which one might take to
mean they are not too smart either (as the serpent seems to intuit).
Note that skin clothes will be a gift of the somewhat sorry divinity
at the end of this story. The origin of clothing is told here in the
same breath as that of craftiness and judgment, which is judgment
between at least pairs of opposites (naked/clothed. Properly
clothed/improperly clothed, etc.). Idea of text (textus).</P>

<P>3.1 And the serpent was the most `<U>arum</U> of all creatures:
the most naked or the wisest, wiliest, smartest of all creatures?
Perhaps the molting habit of snakes is at the root of the word play:
snakes are at the same time naked and clothed (by a smooth, bright
kind of skin left behind?). As in folktales, the serpent plays its
role of trickster: "So, <U>Elohim</U> (not <U>yahweh elohim</U>)
said: 'you shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?" Is this the
normal slope of the human mind speaking when presented with a
prohibition and trying to figure the weakness in the proposition or
prohibition, the "angle"?</P>

<P>The serpent speaks to the woman in the plural: man is there,
listening?</P>

<P><U>Nahash</U> / serpent, compare to <U>lahash</U> / whispering;
<U>rahash</U> / quiet sounds. The <I>piel</I> <U>nihesh</U> means to
divine, so this serpent could be seen as a revealer? Note: God
"said", not "commanded."</P>

<P>Opening the eyes: Why didn't god tell the human beings about this
"opening" before? Did God wish that humanity have a taste of death?
See Abarbanel's interpretation.</P>

<P>Knowledge: knowledge of everything is promised. But later on, it
is partial knowledge that we see at work.</P>

<P>The whole story is about moral autonomy, the development of a code
of ethics. See Spinoza, <I>Ethics</I>, 4.1-2.</P>

<P>After the gaining of knowledge, we have the first creative act, an
invention or putting together of pre-existing materials, a little
&agrave; la Elohim.</P>

<P>In 3.2-3, the woman corrects the serpent, but overcorrects. First
she speaks of the tree in the middle of the garden as forbidden
(which is not necessarily the right tree), then adds "don't touch,"
and doesn't repeat the death formula quite in the same way. The
divine word is therefore distorted in three ways, in the woman‘s
maximalist response to the serpent‘s minimalist interpretation.
Human words are apparently innately off target, in a remarkable
difference from the fully realized divine words.</P>

<P>3.4ff. The serpent keeps talking about "<U>elohim</U>" alone, and
suggests that the tree will turn the humans themselves into
<U>elohim</U>. [Note of biblical theology: Jewish tradition has
long interpreted the double naming of the divinity in these first
three chapters as representing two essential aspects of the godhead.
Those two aspects are justice (represented by <U>elohim</U>, source
of inexorable judgment) and love or compassion (hidden in
<U>yhwh</U>, the <U>tetragrammaton</U>).</P>

<P>3.6-7 insists on the desirable aspects of the fruit ("she saw..
the fruit good to eat ... attractive to the eyes, and desirable for
understanding." Seeing is followed by consumption. Knowledge is
knowledge of a lack, which leads to the first "veil" of culture, a
rough kind of sewing, with fig leaves (fig tree: early metaphor for
the Torah, the teaching by the godhead, sweet food and divine
gift).</P>

<P>3.8ff. Contrast of the "hearing" of the voice of the lord God with
the previous "seeing." Man and woman hide in the middle of the trees
in the garden (<U>gan</U>, but soon <U>pardes</U> in tradition, from
the Greek <U>paradeisos</U>, itself from Persian <U>par-dassah</U>?).
God calls, "Where are you?", but man doesn't answer "<U>hinneni</U>,
Here I am" as Abraham will be seen doing. He is afraid because he is
naked: without protection? without weaponry?</P>

<P>Then, we witness a descent in responsibility, and ascent in
punishment.</P>

<P>3.16a the "desire": notice that the same formulation of desire and
mastery will return in the story of Cain and Abel, in 4.7b, but the
pronouns are different.</P>

<P>In 3.20, the woman is named Eve.</P>

<P>3.21 Special clothes are made by God for the first couple: leather
shirts (or skin, from what animal?). Regret by the divinity after the
outburst of punishment? About vegetarianism in the garden of Eden:
What is the origin of the leather clothing, a divine gift, then?</P>

<P>3.22-24 "like one of us": the Elohim? Jealousy of God? The man is
expelled from <U>Gan Eden</U>, to work the soil from which he was
taken: East of Eden.</P>

<P>The <U>Keruvim</U> (griffin-like creatures, of the kind seen at
the entrance to Assyrian temples) and the bright spinning sword
guarding the way to the tree of life (preventing return but also
indicating the way back to Eden). Is the text thinking of the Temple
in Jerusalem, where <U>Keruvim</U> stood guard in the Holy of Holies
in the Jerusalem Temple?</P>

<P>[compare to the trepsing by Gilgamesh]</P>

<P>Contrary to expectations (patrilocalism), the man follows the
woman.</P>

<P>At the end of 3.23: the human being (the "adam") is sent to work
the soil from which he had been taken (<U>asher luqah misham</U>)
taken from which place (2.16)? West of Eden?</P>
