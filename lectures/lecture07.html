<h3 id="development-of-hebrew-bible">Development of Hebrew Bible</h3>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Three models for reconstruction of the history of the Biblical text according to John Van Seters (<em>The Pentateuch: A social-science commentary</em>. London: Bloomsbury, 2015). 
        <ol>
    <li> an analysis and reconstruction of fragments, saga-like sometimes (he refuses this term), cycles of stories, that formed blocks of texts. These individual narratives were then collected and edited. The larger blocks were eventually combined, at the end-stage of composition.</li>
    <li> the supplemental model starts from a basic \emph{Urtext} of the Pentateuch or Hexateuch that would have been expanded over time. This is the model eventually favored by Van Seters. It can restore creativity at all stages and doesn't invoke a redacting activity that Van Seters rejects as unnecessary.</li>
    <li> the strata or sources and documents model. Here, inconsistencies (or what are taken to be such) lead to the analysis of long narrative sources that are independent of each other though often parallel. They would have been combined by redactors later in a final form. In this model, the problems of coherence and cohesion are attributed to the redaction level.</li>
    </ol>
        </li>
<li>Documentary hypothesis (Wellhausen et al):
<ol type="1">
<li>J, E, D, P, and redactors</li>
<li>key questions: Deuteronomy, Samuel and Kings, Prophetic literature;</li>
<li>Problems posed by the claim of historicity of Genesis and Exodus;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>History of monotheism:
<ol type="1">
<li>El, Yahweh, Asherah, Astarte, Baal? Mythological views of the world developed by kings and temple personnel concerned with stability of society. Criticized as being an Israelite failure, later a Judahite failure. No chaos allowed, anti-chaos as Yhwh figure of power.</li>
<li>Henotheism or monolatry, with more exclusive focus on YHWH.
<ul>
<li>9th–7th centuries (ostraca; development of writing); <img src="../../images/kh_qeyafa/Qeiyafa_Ostracon1.jpg" alt="Qeiyafa Ostracon1" /> <img src="../../images/kh_qeyafa/ostracon_galil.jpg" alt="Ostracon Galil" /></li>
<li>Texts (?): annals of kings, epics (Psalms), sagas (Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses); prophetic texts;</li>
<li>8th-7th centuries: stories of salvation out of Egypt?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explanations of fall of Israel (northern kingdom): loss of favor with YHWH (cult failure, mix of gods, ethics), criticisms by Judahite prophets and writers.</li>
<li>Restructuring ca. 600 and after (one century):
<ul>
<li>Deuteronomy (who are the writers?)</li>
<li>Exodus</li>
<li>Prophetic literature</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>New theories about the development of the Hebrew Bible:
<ul>
<li>E?</li>
<li>J? not from 10th century</li>
<li>D: how many versions?</li>
<li>P: major writer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why and how were the Abram-Isaac-Jacob cycles incorporated? Both southern and northern stories: memories of local cultures transmitted even under kings? Stories that prefigure the Exodus story and the covenant with the whole nation? Prefiguration also of exile and return, as well as justification of rights of returnees? Justification of monotheism by its antiquity? Justification also of the long-standing divine interest in a specific people.</li>
