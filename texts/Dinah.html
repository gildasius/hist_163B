In this sense, the story seems whollyunrelated to the broader historical saga in which it is located, and this onlycompounded the mystery of its overall meaning for ancient interpreters. Why hadit been included in Scripture? To many, it seemed that the story must containsome kind of moral lesson, but if so, the overall message was unclear.

Simeon andLevi did well to kill not only him and his father, but the other men of Shechemas well, for they had cooperated in Shechem's crime or had a history of evilbehavior. Indeed, Jacob's sons were merely instruments of divine punishment,for God Himself had sentenced the Shechemites to die for their crimes. As forDinah, she eventually married Job, a descendant of Jacob's brother, Esau.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p></div></body></html>
