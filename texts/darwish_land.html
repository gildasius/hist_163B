Selected   poems</em>. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003 (translated and edited   by M. Akash and C. Forché). </p><h3>The land of the stranger, the serene land </h3><p>As with you, there is a land at the border of a land within me, <br>  filled with you, or with your absence. <br>  I do not know the songs you cry as I walk in your mist. <br>  Let the land be what you gesture toward, and what you undertake. <br>  <br>  Southerly, it never ceases to revolve around you and itself. <br>  It has two brief stays in the sky: summer and winter. <br>  As for spring and its moods, that is your affair alone. <br>  Rise to any woman within you, and daisies will appear <br>  on every window in the city, golden, like the summer of the<em> Little Prince</em>.   <br>  As for autumn, and interpreting it as tired gold, that is my affair. <br>  When I feed the church's pigeons my bread, I forget the freedom of marble. <br>  When you walk among statues, I follow the scent of mandarin. <br>  <br>  Traveling around its images in your mirrors: <br>  <em>O my daughter, I have no mother, so give birth to me here</em>. <br>  Thus the land places its secret in the body, <br>  and marries woman to man. <br>  So take me to her, to you, to me. <br>  There, here, within me and without. <br>  And take me so that my soul will rest in you <br>  and I can dwell in the serene land. <br>  Heavenly, I have nothing to say about the land in you <br>  except what the stranger says: <em>heavenly</em>. <br>  Perhaps the strangers mispronounce Aramaic letters. <br>  Perhaps they make their gods from the primitive materials <br>  they find on riverbanks, but they do sing well. <br>  This land is heavenly, like clouds lifting from jasmine. <br>  <br>  Metaphorical, like the poem before it is written: <br>  <em>O son, I have no father, so give birth to me.</em> <br>  The land speaks to me when I pass gently over it. <br>  In your crystal night glittering between butterflies, <br>  there is no blood on the ploughs, and virginity renews itself. <br>  There is no name for what life should be, except <br>  what you did and what you do to my soul. </p><hr><small>Posted 5/4/04 (gh),revised Tuesday, 16 January 2018</small></body></html>
