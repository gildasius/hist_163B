                    <li>read <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=389814959" target="blank">Genesis 1--11</a> (New Revised Standard Version = NRSV), and re-read Gen 1--3; read also the Babylonian Epic of Creation, the so-called <a href="https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3155679" target="blank">Enuma Eliš</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>While reading Genesis 1--3, think about the following questions: a) Is Genesis 1 a poem? What features of the text lead you to think so? b) Could Genesis 1 be used to justify monarchy? c) What view of nature does the text of Gen 1 propose? d) Do you think the second text (Genesis 2:4b to 3) is older or more recent than Genesis 1--2:4a? Do both these texts complement each other?

            <li style="list-style: none">I have a one-page discussion of the notion of <a href="lectures/creation.html" target="blank">myth vs history</a> in regard to Genesis 1--11. I also have notes on the text of <a href="lectures/Gen1_1.html" target="blank">Gen 1-3</a>. As a modern interpretation that we could discuss, you might be interested by this <a href="texts/Genesis_Blame_LRB_20180308.pdf" target="blank">recent comment on Gen 1-3 and views on sexuality</a>, by Anne Enright (from the <em>London Review of Books</em>, 3/15/18). I highly recommend Marilynne Robinson's moving novels and essays, for instance <em>Home</em>, <em>Gilead</em>, or <em>Lila</em>, because they are about the fallibility and greatness of human life. All of her books can help our thinking on the stories of creation and Cain and Abel.

                        <strong>First paper:</strong> (1500 words, due Tue April 23): Based on course lectures and comparison of Gen 1--3 with the Babylonian *Creation Epic*, give your interpretation of the main ideas that the authors of Gen 1--3 intended to convey. You may focus on one theme or another. For instance, you may compare the way in which ancient epic texts such as the <em>Enuma Eliš</em> and Genesis 1--3 could be used politically (by kings or other elites). Or you may reflect upon the meaning of the creation of "the adam" (=humankind) in Genesis 1:26--27, the different account in Genesis 2--3, and compare them to the creation of man in the Babylonian epic (Enuma Eliš, Tablet VI, lines 1--34).

                        <li>What view of women's roles in their family and in history did the well scene in Gen 24 mean to convey? Did it reinforce what was expected from women in kinship arrangements or did it bring something new? Base yourself not only on the story of Rebekah in Gen 24, but also on the stories about Sarah (Gen 12 in Egypt; 18:1--15; 20--21; 23), Hagar (16; 21), and even the extreme case of the daughters of Lot (19:30--38).</li>
                        <li>Chapters 12 to 22 in Genesis have seven iterations of the promise to Abra(ha)m of descendance, land and universal blessing. These covenants or contracts are intertwined with a number of discrete events in Abra(ha)m's and Sarai(h)'s lives. Why do the authors develop the story of Abraham and descendance in this way? What values do they consider important in the lives of these putative ancestors and why?</li>

                        <p>We live in a period of great freedom (can we call it
                        neo-liberalism?). Features of it are that we are
                        autonomous (protective of our autonomy and completely
                        opposed to any form of heteronomy), yet connected
                        through global markets whose laws we accept and use. We
                        insist on the defense of everyone's access to full
                        human rights, while being concerned about fitting, day
                        to day, in a complex, interconnected world.

                        <p>What meaning can a study of Genesis and its history
                        have for a modern person? Is it just a historical
                        curiosity, even though it may still have some
                        importance because of its long influence on the three
                        monotheistic traditions, on art and literature? Has it
                        run its course socially (because of the globalism of
                        our world) and ethically (kinship structures and
                        conceptions of gender have changed). Are we done with
                        its assumed heteronomy (revealed law)?

                        <p>Or is it still important to study this text because,
                        once the historical situation of its writers is better
                        understood and taken seriously, it still speaks to some
                        aspects of our experience? Parts of the text that would
                        help in discussing this question are the stories of
                        creation, the story cycle of Abraham and Sarah, and the
                        Jacob saga, with its trickery and more complex
                        relationships.</li>

            Last class:
            <ol>
                
            <li>Discussion of the last paper and the themes that can by pursued
            in answering the basic question: “Why is it still important to
            study Genesis and its historical context?” A number of themes
            were proposed in the general discussion. Here is a suggestive list
            that I collected after the class. Some may be merged as they
            recouped each other:
            
                <ul> 
                    
                    <li>An analysis of how modern fiction used Genesis in its
                    story-telling and exploration of values, ancient an modern.
                    A book by Dara Horn,, <em>A guide for the perplexed</em>,
                    was suggested in class (Nomi_) A film like <em>East of
                    Eden</em> could be used also.</li>
                           
                    <li>Does Genesis introduce a human history that is open to
                    the future and presents hope as a value? How does it do
                    that? This may take the form of an analysis of the story of
                    creation, the notion of the humans as images of the divine,
                    the nature of the choices offered to the first humans, Cain
                    and Abel, Abraham and Sarah, Jacob and his family, and
                    Joseph. How different is this openness from the kind of
                    ideology and cosmologies that were used by ancient kingdoms
                    to justify the return to order and to a putative Golden
                    Age? Why was order and absence of chaos so important for
                    ancient political regimes? The question could be extended
                    to modern regimes and their occasional attempt to return to
                    a golden age or some form of equilibrium. Finally, when and
                    why did the authors of Genesis come up with this view of
                    the world and the role of humankind in it?</li>
                    
                    <li>Another theme that we haven't explored in depth in the
                    class but is important is the nature and origin of
                    sin. We don't use that word in modern times, though we tend
                    to remain very demanding and sometimes censorious in our
                    ethical views of the world. The word “sin” appears for the
                    first time in the story of Cain and Abel (Gen 4). The
                    concept of sin, be it error or a more complex mix of
                    mistake and moral intention ("evil impulse" or rebellion),
                    was common to all ancient cultures that were mentioned in
                    class. Do you think that polytheistic societies had a solid
                    explanation for sin, as provided by their cosmologies? And
                    doesn't the notion of a perfect world, as described in
                    Genesis 1:1--2:4a, make an explanation for the existence of
                    sin difficult if not impossible? </li>
                    
                    <li>The question of the usefulness of reading Genesis in
                    modern times could start with an examination of the notions
                    of freedom and slavery as they crop up in Genesis. There is
                    no specific word being used for “freedom” in Genesis but
                    the idea of liberation, or rather salvation by God, is
                    clearly fundamental. How do the choices of Adam and Eve,
                    Abraham and Sarah (vs Lot), Rebekah, Jacob vs Esau, and
                    especially Joseph, illustrate their search for independence
                    and freedom? Are similar issues present in modern society?
                    That is, are present people, so keen on their freedoms,
                    still struggling with slavery even though slavery proper
                    has been nearly eradicated?</li>
                    
                    <li>One aspect of Genesis that we have seen time and again
                    in class is the conflict or tension between first born
                    son(s) and the younger son(s). How is it developed? It is a
                    straighforward business to follow this theme through the
                    stories of Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and
                    Jacob, Leah and Rachel, the ten brothers and Joseph (plus
                    Benjamin, who seems left out).</br> But it is not as simple
                    to come up with reasons why the authors of Genesis framed
                    this conflict as they did. Was there a political and
                    theological goal being pursued? Was their promotion of
                    younger sons (and even daughters in the case of Rachel) a
                    way to introduce a vision of history that was at odds with
                    what was normally practiced?</br> Finally, in modern
                    society, is there something comparable going on in our
                    vision of politics? I'm thinking of the way we can be very
                    critical of power and protective of the weak, suspicious
                    about force and looking for grace.</li>
                    
                    <li>Last theme I think about---and again, the suggestions
                    and questions I'm collecting here can be mixed and
                    reshaped, of course, in forming your own answer to the main
                    question (Why read Genesis now?)---the last theme is the
                    question of ethnic development or what I called
                    <em>ethnogenesis</em>. What do the stories of Genesis tell
                    the reader about the notion of a people, of a nation? Is it
                    defined mainly by genetics (biologically, or by biological
                    descent), or is it shaped by choice? The critical texts
                    here are: the story of Abraham, from Genesis 12 to 25; the
                    story of Lot and daughters; and finally the story of Joseph
                    who becomes an Egyptian, leading even to a change of name.
                    We see Judah in Genesis 38 become nearly Canaanite. The
                    brothers of Joseph, during their visits to Egypt, say
                    repeatedly that they come from Canaan. Yet, Canaanites are
                    reviled by the rest of the Bible. The full answer requires
                    consideration of the book of Exodus in which the people of
                    Israel are defined by accepting the covenant they receive
                    directly at Sinai, before having a land (the “promised
                    land”). But it is possible to answer this question without
                    knowledge of Exodus by reflecting on the stories I
                    mentioned above.<br> It would be good to think at the same
                    time about the modern situation and what constitutes us as
                    people. Does Genesis help with rethinking and redefining
                    our modern idea of belonging?</li> </ul></li>
                    
            <li>Overview of Genesis 42--45: the story of the double trip to
            Egypt by the brothers, the recognition scene, and the decision by
            Jacob to go to Egypt to see his favorite son, Joseph. In class, I
            went over five themes that are of varying importance when trying to
            explain the goals of the author(s) of this novella that goes from
            Gen 37 to Gen 50:
                  <ul>
                      
                      <li>The story of Joseph supplies an explanation for the
                      presence of all descendants of Jacob in Egypt. After many
                      years, the “Israelites” (descendants of Jacob) are all
                      participants in the story of Exodus, which is
                      characterized by four components:
                          
                          <ul>
                              <li>a story of salvation or liberation;</li>
                              <li>the story of the giving of the law or of the
                                   covenant, done directly by God;</li>
                              <li>the promise of the land (conditional on
                                   accepting the covenant);</li>
                              <li>the desert sanctuary as guide (with a mobile
                                   divinity);</li></ul>
                                   
                        <li>The brothers' hate for Joseph and the famine in
                        Canaan turn out to be providential. The divine will or
                        plan is now hidden behind complex appearances. It
                        actually uses downturns (prison and slavery) into
                        liberation and victories. In the stories of creation,
                        Abraham, and Jacob, the divine voice came from outside,
                        in the fullness of day (though occasionally in dreams
                        for Jacob). Now it is built in, still as an external,
                        single divine will, but inherent (immanent) to the
                        historical process.</li>
                        
                        <li>The development of providence in the story means
                        that interpretation of dreams and other voices or signs
                        is now required to figure out what divine will is (or
                        in modern terms: the historical process). The knowledge
                        of things to come is not accessible to “magicians” or
                        “wise men” of Egypt. There is some ethnical pride
                        attached to the “knowledgeable” Joseph (as for Daniel
                        in the book of Daniel, in a similar situation), as
                        compared to the failing wisdom of Egypt (famous in
                        antiquity).</li>
                        
                        <li>There is a royal undercurrent or theme: the story
                        of Joseph justifies the existence of the kingdoms of
                        Israel and Judah, while incorporating criticisms and
                        failures right from the beginning. Reuben, Judah,
                        Simeon and Levi are blamed for their failure. They are
                        the ancestors of the northern and southern Israelite
                        kings. Further, both Joseph and Judah are presented as
                        losing their ethnic identity or endangering it. Judah
                        becomes almost a Canaanite, and Joseph an Egyptian.
                        This is of course from the point of view of a narrator
                        who is reflecting on the political and theological
                        situation long after the fall of the real kingdoms of
                        Israel and Judah.</li>
                        
                        <li>Lastly, there is the theme of the solidarity of
                        brothers (Gen 42--45), in spite of the initial jealousy
                        and hate. This solidarity and renewed kinship may be a
                        reflection of the important theme of brotherhood
                        developed in the books of Deuteronomy and
                        Ezra-Nehemiah. </li>
